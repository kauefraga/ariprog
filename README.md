I had a test (03/2024) on arithmetic progressions, so I decided to create a library to study math. Taking advantage of the fact that I was studying Rust and APs, I created this library.

The objetive of **ariprog** is to solve the main problems around APs. Here's a list of what it's capable of.

- [x] Get common difference (d)
- [x] Get nth term (an)
- [x] Get first term (a)
- [x] Get how many terms in the AP (n)
- [x] Interpolate/insert arithmetic means
- [x] Get common difference and first term (d, a)

In the [API](#api) section, you'll see the corresponding functions and how to use them.

## üõ† Usage

### Installation

First, create a new Rust project or open an existing one

```bash
cargo new testing-ariprog
cd testing-ariprog

# or
cd existing-project
```

Then, add [**ariprog**](https://crates.io/crates/ariprog) as a dependency

```bash
cargo add ariprog
```

As an alternative, you can add the following line in your `Cargo.toml` (dependencies section)

```bash
ariprog = "0.1.4"
```

### Getting started

```rust
use ariprog::{
    common_difference,
    nth_term
};

fn main() {
    let common_diff = common_difference(6.0, 2.0); // expected 4.0

    println!(
        "The common difference in the AP [2.0, 6.0, 10.0, 14.0] is {}",
        common_diff
    );

    println!(
        "The seventeenth term of the AP [2.0, 6.0, 10.0, 14.0, ...] is {}",
        nth_term(2.0, common_diff, 17.0)
    ); // expected 66.0
}
```

### API

First things first, after adding **ariprog** in your project, import it.

```rust
use ariprog;
```

- Get common difference (d): `ariprog::common_difference`
- Get nth term (an): `ariprog::nth_term`
- Get first term (a): `ariprog::first_term`
- Insert/interpolate arithmetic means: `ariprog::insert_arithmetic_means`
- Get how many terms in the AP (n): `ariprog::how_many_terms`
- Get common difference and first term (d, a): `ariprog::common_difference_and_first_term`

All of these functions have their own documentation. See in [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ariprog) or in your IDE.

## üíñ Contributing

Feel free to fork it, make a change and open a pull request. Same for issues, suggest an API change, an improvement, a feature or report a bug.

### How to contribute

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork on your machine
3. Make your changes, commit and push these

## üß™ Testing

To test ariprog, with the project in your machine, run `cargo test`.

You should create tests in [`tests/unit_test.rs`](tests/unit_test.rs), however if you think that your tests should be in other module, do it and explain why in the PR.
