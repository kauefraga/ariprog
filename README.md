## Features

Here's a list of what **ariprog** is capable of.

- [x] Solve AP problems with `get_common_difference`, `get_first_term`, `get_nth_term` and `insert_arithmetic_means`.
- [ ] Store an AP (`new`) and solve problems with methods.

In the next section, I'll explain how to install and use it.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Create a new Rust project or open an existing one
2. Add [**ariprog**](https://crates.io/crates/ariprog) as a dependency

```bash
# (1)
cargo new testing-ariprog
cd testing-ariprog

# or
cd existing-project

# (2)
cargo add ariprog
```

See below the latest ariprog version.

![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ariprog)

### Getting started

```rust
use ariprog::{get_common_difference, get_nth_term};

fn main() {
    let common_diff = get_common_difference(6.0, 2.0); // expected 4.0

    println!(
        "The common difference in the AP [2.0, 6.0, 10.0, 14.0] is {}",
        common_diff
    );

    println!(
        "The seventeenth term of the AP [2.0, 6.0, 10.0, 14.0, ...] is {}",
        get_nth_term(2.0, common_diff, 17.0)
    ); // expected 66.0
}
```

## How to run and where to create tests

To test ariprog, with the project in your machine, run `cargo test`.

You should create tests in [`tests/unit_test.rs`](tests/unit_test.rs), however if you think that your tests should be in other module, do it and explain why in the PR.
